# Project Title

This project is part of my graduation requirements. It aims to develop a mobile application to address issues with traditional coin-operated washing machines, which require an exact amount of coins or cash, leading to inconvenience and operational problems. 

## Project Overview

The developed application mitigates these limitations by introducing a point-based payment system. Users can top up points and operate the washing machine via the app without the need for cash. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller, which connects to the application via the MQTT protocol for real-time data exchange. This enables fast and efficient communication between devices, allowing users to control the washing machine, check its status, and monitor its operation directly through the app.
